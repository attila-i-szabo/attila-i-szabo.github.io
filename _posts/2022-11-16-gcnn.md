Obtaining the low-energy physics of frustrated magnets is a challenging task for all computational methods.
Quantum Monte Carlo, in particular, suffers from the *Monte Carlo sign problem*:
Roughly speaking, the signs (or complex phases) that capture interference effects in quantum wave functions cannot be captured as a probability distribution, so one cannot efficiently sample from them.
A priori, neural quantum states do not have this issue; however, many NQS ansätze split the wav function into its phase and magnitude, which makes it difficult to learn the former in a training procedure with destructive interference.

Together with [Chris Roth](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YGOQvqwAAAAJ) of UT Austin, I have solved this problem for the $ J_1 - J_2 $ Heisenberg model on the square lattice.
We used the *group-convolutional neural network* (GCNN) ansatz first proposed by Chris: in these, the wave function is written as the sum of a number of terms, which makes tracking destructive interferences much easier.

![Ansätze with separate wave function amplitudes and phases (left) cannot track destructive interferences. Writing the wave function as a sum of terms (right) improves the issue.](/assets/2022/11/zero.png)

In addition, they are designed to impose the spatial symmetries of the problem on the wave function.
