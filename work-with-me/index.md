Currently, I have no PhD or postdoctoral positions to advertise.

### Master's (semester,...) projects

If you are a master's student in Zürich (at the University or at ETH) and interested in [my research](/research/), please feel free to reach out to me about doing your master's project or a semester project with me.
I currently offer the following project topics:

- Classification of topological phases with neural networks
- Anderson-Higgs mechanism in quantum spin liquids
- Tensor networks for complex orders *(with Juraj Hasik)*

If any of [my recent work](/cv/publications) particularly interests you, we may also invent a new project based on that.
