Hi! I am a theoretical condensed-matter physicist, interested in the exotic phenomena brought about by strong correlations between electrons in materials.

I pursue these phenomena using a variety of analytical and computational techniques. I am particularly interested in machine-learning tools, such as neural quantum states. I also enjoy collaborating with experimental colleagues and have considerable experience with neutron-scattering studies of magnetism.

Currently, I work as a postdoc at the [MPI-PKS](https://www.pks.mpg.de/) in Dresden.
I will start as an Ambizione fellow at the [University of Zürich](https://www.physik.uzh.ch/) in September.
