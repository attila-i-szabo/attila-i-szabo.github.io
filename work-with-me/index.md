Currently, I have no PhD or postdoctoral positions to advertise.

### Master's, bachelor, and semester projects

If you are a bachelor's or master's student in Zürich (at the University or at ETH) and interested in [my research](/research/), please feel free to reach out to me about doing your bachelor's/master's project or a semester project with me.

I currently offer the following project topics:

#### Master's projects

- Classification of topological phases with neural networks
- Anderson-Higgs mechanism in quantum spin liquids
- Tensor networks for complex orders *(with Juraj Hasik)*
- Neural-network wave functions for fermions *(with Dan Mao and Simon Hille)*

#### Bachelor/semester projects

- Matrix product states for the Kitaev honeycomb model *(with Simon Hille)*

If any of [my recent work](/cv/publications) particularly interests you, we may also invent a new project based on that.
